# Basic Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, a sample script that deploys that contract, and an example of a task implementation, which simply lists the available accounts.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```bash

MasterChefCronus address: 0x5C6ef4d8b2Ebd1362E711BDF7Ae6291c14609954
CronusToken address: 0x8Ce12Cb0CBAE2463b7f0f659449E2fD4988dB5B1


```
